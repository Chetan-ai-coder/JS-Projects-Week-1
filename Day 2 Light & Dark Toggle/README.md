# Day 2 - Basic DOM Manipulation

This day focuses on learning how to interact with the DOM (Document Object Model) using JavaScript.

## 🔍 What it Does:
- Takes input from the user via a text field.
- On button click, displays the entered text dynamically on the page using JavaScript.

## 💻 Technologies Used:
- HTML
- JavaScript (DOM manipulation)

## 📂 Files Included:
- `index.html` – Contains input field and button.
- `Day02.js` – Contains logic to handle user input and display it on the page.

## 🧠 Concepts Covered:
- DOM Selection (`getElementById`)
- Event Listeners (`addEventListener`)
- Creating elements with `createElement`
- Appending elements with `appendChild`
- Updating the DOM dynamically

## 📌 Output Example:
User types `Hello World` in the input → clicks "Submit" → sees a new paragraph added with `Hello World` as its text.

# 🗓️ Day 4 - To-Do List App

## 📌 Description
A simple and interactive **To-Do List App** built using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**.  
Users can type a task, add it to the list, and remove it whenever they want.

---

## 🛠️ Features
- ✅ Add new tasks using the input field and Submit button.
- ❌ Delete any task using the "Delete" button next to it.
- 📃 All tasks are stored in a JavaScript array (`tasks[]`), which can be useful for future enhancements like local storage or backend integration.
- 🎯 Real-time updates to the UI without reloading the page.

## 💡 What I Learned
- DOM Manipulation (creating, appending, and removing elements dynamically)
- Handling user inputs and events (`addEventListener`)
- Styling elements using **Flexbox**
- Managing task data in an **array**
- Clearing input fields after task submission
